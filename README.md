# Javascript-1.0
This is the very basic course of Javascript in which I covered almost all topics that are important to know for being a Javascript developer.
# Exercise 1
Swapping variable's values:

let a=10;

let b=20;

Output should look like:

console.log(a); // => 20

console.log(b); // => 10
# Exercise 2
Calculate the area and circumference of a circle where radius is equal to 10.

let r = 10;

Output should look like:

Print a label before each result i.e area of circle , circumference of circle

console.log(circleCircum); // => 62.8

console.log(circleArea); // => 314
