# Javascript-1.0
This is the very basic course of Javascript in which I covered almost all topics that are important to know for being a Javascript developer.
# Exercise 1
Swapping variable's values:</br>
let a=10;</br>
let b=20;</br>
Output should look like: </br>
console.log(a); // => 20 </br>
console.log(b); // => 10 </br>
# Exercise 2
Calculate the area and circumference of a circle where radius is equal to 10.</br>
let r = 10; </br>
Output should look like: </br>
Print a label before each result i.e area of circle , circumference of circle </br>
console.log(circleCircum); // => 62.8 </br>
console.log(circleArea); // => 314 </br>
# Exercise 3
Write a function that takes two numbers and return the maximum of the two.
# Exercise 4
Write function isLandscape(width,height) which take width and height, return true if Landscape else false.
# Exercise 5
fizzbuzz algorithm: </br>
write a function fizzbuzz(input), which take an input, if the number is divisable by 3 return string 'fizz',</br>
if the number is divisable by 5 return string 'buzz', if divisable by both 3 and 5 then return string 'fizzbuzz',</br>
if input is not a number return string 'Not a number'.</br>
Finally if input is number but not divisable by both simply return that number.
# Exercise 6
I want you to implement this function, checkSpeed(speed), this function takes a parameter that's the speed of a car.
Now in this program, I'm assuming that speed limit is 70 km an hour. So if a car is driving under the speed limit, we get this Ok message on the console. Similarly if we pass 70 here, so if somebody is driving exactly at the speed limit, we're still good. We still get the Ok message. Now for every five kilometers above the speed limit, they're going to get 1 point. So if I drive at 75 km an hour, I get 1 point here. But what if I drive at 72 km an hour? I'm still good. So for every 5 km, above the speed limit, we should give the driver 1 point. Now as part of calculating the point here, you will have to use one of the built in
 functions in JavaScript that is Math.floor. We can give this function a floating point number, like 1.3, let's say 1.3 points, and this will convert that to the greatest integer, for example if we go to the console here, and type math.floor of 1.3, we get 1. So you will have to use this function as part of your calculations okay, now here is a tip for you. Back to our checkSpeed function, what if you passed 80 here? We should get 2 points right? So we get 2 points, beautiful. Now what if we drive at 180 km an hour? Our license is suspended. So if a driver gets more than 12 points, then their license should be suspended.

# Exercise 7
 I want you to write a function called showNumbers(limit) that takes a parameter called limit. So we pass a number here, like 10, and when we call this function, we should call all the numbers from 0 to the number we supplied as the limit. Now next to each number if that number is even we should display the even number, otherwise we should display odd.
